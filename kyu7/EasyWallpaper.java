/**
 * John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He has been said that making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper
 * is more complex than it sounds. He wants a fool-proof method to getting it right.
 * <p>
 * John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters.
 * The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in
 * mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so
 * he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.
 * <p>
 * Last time he did these calculations he caught a headache so could you help John? Your function wallpaper(l, w, h)
 * should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.
 * <p>
 * #Example: wallpaper(4, 3.5, 3) should return "ten"
 * <p>
 * #Notes:
 * <p>
 * all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
 * 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that w x h x l is zero
 * the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20
